DUPIT aims to make 3D scanning as easy and accessible as 2D scanning. It is an iOS application (under development), which uses [photogrametry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) tools, to create a 3D model of any object of any size. Be it Buckingham Palace or your friend Joe! The only requirement is that there must be sufficient photos of that object, such that the taken photos overlap.

  * Authentication

## How DUPIT works?
After loging in, user takes a minimum of 20 photos of the object they want to 3D scan, and sends the photos to us. We then create a 3D model out of those images and return it to the user's device. Users can export a video of the model to their social media accounts or place an order to recieve the 3D-printed model.

## Why it's not completed?
The API of the photogrametry tool is not publicly available yet. We'll continue development as soon as it becomes available.
